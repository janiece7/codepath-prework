## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X ] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [X] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [ X] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [ X] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [ X] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [ X] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [ X] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [X ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

I used W3schools.com to help me understand more of the css portion of the project.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it?  

Getting used to programming in different components was a challenge for me while working on this project. It was my first time combining HTML, Javascript, and CSS to complete a project. When I got to the javascript section, I was surprised because I'm used to using Java. As a result, it took me some time to figure out how the functions and methods in this project worked together. I overcame this by sticking to the resources provided and researching more about the subject when I was challenged to finish the work. I also took a step back and looked at the code itself to see how each section interacted with one another. This really helped me feel less overwhelmed by what I didn't know, and it allowed me to compartmentalize it. This piqued my interest in how javasvript works, and I was eager to see how the pieces fit together to form a fully interactive project. In the future, I hope to continue learning more about this field and discovering new ways to improve my development.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? 

  I'd like to learn how to make dynamic web applications. After finishing this project, I was very curious to see how the methods for playing the sound worked. I'm interested in developing interactive and comprehensive web applications. Some questions I may have concern the classes and functionalities used to create this game.
 I'm also curious to see how many games and applications work today and if they follow a similar structure to how this game was created. Also, what resources are available to continue learning about web development and how to advance in this field of technology? Finally, I'd like to know how much web development has grown over the years, and what people are looking forward to in this field.
 
 
4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. 

If I had more time to work on this project, I would have tried to incorporate a time clock and moving tiles. The game would have become more interactive and challenging for future users as a result. I would have also edited the project's heading and words because I believe a more dynamic effect would have shown the fun environment. I would have also improved the functionality of the buttons when they were clicked. Another suggestion is to include a hint component as the game's difficulty increases.
